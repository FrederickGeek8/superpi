This is a quick little python script I cooked up that allows you to search Pi for any set of numbers. Example:
<pre>python search.py 51058</pre>
You can find the output at <a href='http://pastebin.com/1zF6YxCx'>Pastebin</a>.

Near the end of the string you would see something that looks like <code>937 [51058] 209</code>
